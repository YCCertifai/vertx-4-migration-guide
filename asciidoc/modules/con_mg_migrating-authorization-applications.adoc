= Migrating the authorization applications

Authorization is a new feature in {VertX} {v4}. In earlier releases, you could only check if a user was authorized to perform the tasks on the `User` object. This meant that the provider was responsible for both authentication and authorization of the user.

In {VertX} {v4}, the `User` object instances are not associated with a particular authentication provider. So you can authenticate and authorize a user using different providers. For example, you can authenticate a user using OAuth2 and perform authorization checks against MongoDB or SQL database.

The following example shows how an application checks if a user can use Printer #1234 in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
// omitting the error handling for brevity
user.isAuthorized("printers:printer1234", res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    boolean hasAuthority = res.result();
    if (hasAuthority) {
      System.out.println("User can use the printer");
    } else {
      System.out.println("User cannot use the printer");
    }
  }
});
----

This authorization worked for JDBC and MongoDB. However it did not work for providers such as OAuth2, because the provider did not perform authorization checks. From {VertX} {v4}, it is possible to perform such authorization checks by using different providers.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
// omitting the error handling for brevity
provider.getAuthorizations(user, res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    if (PermissionBasedAuthorization.create("printer1234").match(user)) {
      System.out.println("User can use the printer");
    } else {
      System.out.println("User cannot use the printer");
    }
  }
});
----

You can check authorizations on roles, permissions, logic operations, wildcards and any other implementation you add.
