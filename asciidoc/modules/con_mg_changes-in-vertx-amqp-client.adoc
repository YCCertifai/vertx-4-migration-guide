= Changes in {VertX} AMQP client

The following section describes the changes in {VertX} AMQP client.

== Removed methods in AMQP client that contain `AmqpMessage` argument

The AMQP client methods that had `Handler<AmqpMessage>` as an argument have been removed. In earlier releases, you could set this handler on  `ReadStream<AmqpMessage>`. However, if you migrate your applications to use futures, such methods cannot be used.

|===
|Removed methods|Replacing methods
|`AmqpClient.createReceiver(String address,  Handler<AmqpMessage> messageHandler, ...)`| `AmqpClient createReceiver(String address, Handler<AsyncResult<AmqpReceiver>> completionHandler)`
|`AmqpConnection createReceiver(..., Handler<AsyncResult<AmqpReceiver>> completionHandler)`|`AmqpConnection createReceiver(String address, Handler<AsyncResult<AmqpReceiver>> completionHandler)`
|`AmqpConnection createReceiver(.., Handler<AmqpMessage> messageHandler, Handler<AsyncResult<AmqpReceiver>> completionHandler)`|`AmqpConnection createReceiver(String address, Handler<AsyncResult<AmqpReceiver>> completionHandler)`
